    Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game for two players
    regarded as a worldwide classic. It is played on a game board with numbered
    squares with a number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board,
    each connecting two specific squares.

    The game is a simple race based on sheer luck. Each player starts with a token
    on the starting square (1). Players take turns rolling two dice to move their
    token by the number of squares indicated by the dice roll. Tokens follow
    a fixed route marked on the board.

    If on completion of a move, a player lands on the lower end of a ladder,
    the player moves the token up the ladders highest numbered square by clicking
    the block he is standing on. Similarly, if a player lands on the head of a
    snake, then the player moves down to the snake's tail by clicking on
    the block. You are not allowed to throw the dice before moving up the ladder,
    or down the snake.

    If the  number on both dice is the same, the same player takes another turn.

    The player that lands EXACTLY on block nr 36 wins. If he or she gets a higher
    value on the dice, the player will move back the remaining value.

    Have fun!
