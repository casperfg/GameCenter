Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game for two or more players
regarded as a worldwide classic. It is played on a game board with numbered
squares with a number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board,
each connecting two specific squares.

The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece,
according to dice rolls, from the start (bottom left square)
to the finish (top left square).

If you land on the beginning of a ladder you automatically climb to the connecting square,
however if you land on a snake, you fall down. First player to reach the end wins.

Press start to begin the game. The player that gets to go first is chosen on random.
Press your name and watch your piece move to the location according to the dice.
If you get two identical dice, you get to go again.
When you land on a ladder, press the tile you landed on to climb.
